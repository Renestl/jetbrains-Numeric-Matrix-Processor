# Numeric Matrix Processor
Jetbrains Academy Project

## About
Hereâ€™s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.

## Objectives
* Stage 1: Addition 
    - Use nested lists to add matrices.
* Stage 2: Multiplication by number
    - Learn to multiply a matrix by a number and display the result.
* Stage 3: Matrix by matrix multiplication
    - Multiply matrices and create a menu where you can list all the awesome abilities of your matrix processor.
* Stage 4: Transpose
    - Add another useful operation to your processor: allow matrix transposition, and then add this option to the menu.
* Stage 5: Determined!
    - Use recursion to enable your program to find the determinant.
* Stage 6: Inverse matrix
    - Yet another possible operation is finding the inverse of a matrix: add this option to your program.
